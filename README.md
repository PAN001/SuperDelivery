## Introduction
This is a HCI work which aims at designing user-friendly interfaces.

## Background
Some key concepts are adopted during the design stage: interaction design, user experience, cognitive perspective, conceptual model and design, and participatory design. Understand- ing how users and technology communicate with each other is fundamental to this field so that user-centered is always the first considered principle of this app deisgn. The notion of the user experience is central to interaction design. There are many aspects of the user expe- rience taken into consideration during the design: usability, efficiency, utility, learnabilityand memorability. A number of design principles are also considered: visibility, feedback, constraints, consistency and affordance. Additonally, maintaining the app at a easy-to-learn level is also an essential concern. Moreover, cognitive perspective is strongly related to these design principles because it helps users understand by examining humansâ€™ abilities and limitations. They also give many implications to the design, such as adopting metaphors(i.e. icons) to rely on recognition rather than recall due to the limitation of short memory of humans.
